    "description": "Everything you need to know about Effort Values in PokeMMO. Best horde spots that give 10 EVs per battle near PokéCenters, essential items, and efficient strategies to build competitive Pokémon.",
    "whatAreEvs": "What are EVs?",
    "evsExplanation": "Effort Values (EVs) are hidden stats that your Pokémon gains by defeating other Pokémon in battle. Every wild or trainer Pokémon gives a specific amount of EVs in one or more stats when defeated. These EVs directly increase your Pokémon's stats, making EV training essential for competitive play.",
    "maxTotalEvs": "Max total EVs per Pokémon",
    "maxPerStat": "Max per individual stat",
    "evStatPoint": "= +1 stat point at Lv. 100",
    "evSplitExplanation": "In practice, most competitive Pokémon are trained with 252 / 252 / 4 splits — maxing out two key stats and putting the leftover 4 EVs into a third. The stats you choose depend on the Pokémon's role on your team.",
    "howItWorks": "How EV Training Works in PokeMMO",
    "howItWorksDesc": "PokeMMO uses horde encounters as the primary EV training method, which is faster than single-battle training.",
    "hordeTraining": "🎯 Horde Training (Primary Method)",
    "hordeExplanation": "Hordes are groups of 5 wild Pokémon that appear at once. Defeating all 5 gives EVs from each one — meaning 5× the EVs per battle. The best spots have Pokémon that each yield 2 EVs = 10 EVs per horde. Combined with items, you can fully EV train a stat in minutes. Use a Pokémon with a spread move (Earthquake, Surf, Heat Wave, etc.) to KO the entire horde in one turn.",

    "powerItemLabel": "Power Item",
    "powerItemCalc": "50 EVs/horde → 6 hordes",
    "vitaminsTitle": "💊 Vitamins (Quick Start)",
    "vitaminsExplanation": "Use Vitamins (Protein, Iron, Calcium, etc.) to add up to 252 EVs per stat instantly. Each vitamin gives +10 EVs. If you use 10 Vitamins (100 EVs), you only need to horde train the remaining 152 EVs — just 4 hordes with a Power Item. This saves significant time if you have the money.",
    "checkEvs": "📱 Check Your EVs",
    "checkEvsExplanation": "In PokeMMO, you can view your Pokémon's EVs in the Summary screen. The game shows the exact EV distribution in a hexagonal chart, making it easy to track your progress without external tools.",
